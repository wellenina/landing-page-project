# landing-page-project
This is my "silly version" of the landing-page assignment for The Odin Project:
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page


It's a landing page about my cats, who are - obviously! - FBI Agents.


It helped me practice some CSS writing (I finally learned how to use Google fonts and understood why the font-weight property didn't work, learned what the :before and :after are all about, found out that the vertical-align property doesn't work on flex items, etc.).

For this project I also branched a GitHub repo for the first time (YAY!) and learned how to switch branch and commit/push on the right branch, from command line - so yeah, my silly project has actually been useful.

Take a look at the live preview here: https://wellenina.github.io/landing-page-project/
I hope you enjoy looking at my cats as much as I do!
